# 3. Exercise - Publish your agent to the demo site for testing

Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a demo website so that you can invite anyone to test your agent by sending them the URL. This demo website is useful for gathering feedback to improve your content before you activate the agent for your real customers.

In Microsoft Copilot Studio, at the top right of the navigation bar is a **Publish** button.

Select **Publish** to push the latest topics to the demo website. You'll need to complete this action before you can use the demo site and after you make changes to topics you want tested. When developing your personal agent, you'll publish whenever you want to make updated topics available to your users.

Then, select **Publish** again within the **Publish this agent** pop-up dialog.

The publishing process checks for errors in the topics whose Status is On, which should take only a few minutes

After you've selected the Publish option, a green banner notification will show at the top of the screen indicating the agent was published.

To navigate to your demo website, select the **...** ellipses menu in the top-right of Copilot Studio and choose **Go to demo website**.

> **Note**: If there is not a demo website link, you will need to change your security settings to No authentication. To do this, select the Settings menu, and go to the Security tab, then select Authentication on the Security page, choose No authentication in the panel that opens and select Save. You will need to publish the agent again after making this change.

When changing the authentication setting to No authentication, you will receive a warning upon publishing the agent. Ignore this warning and select Publish.

You may now navigate to the demo site via the Overview page or by selecting the ellipses in the top-right of the agent screen and choosing **Go to demo website**.

When the demo site window opens, you can interact with the agent by typing at the Type your message prompt or by selecting a starter phrase from the provided options.
