## Scenario: Contoso Coffee customer support
    Note: 

    You can use the following scenario throughout the labs to build around your agent. You can also use your own scenarios if you prefer.

Contoso Coffee is passionate about providing efficient, environmentally sustainable, and innovative coffee products, barista experiences, and services.

Consumer sentiment is at an all-time high, but with increasing competition, it's important to minimize costs and focus on customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the company can maintain its competitive edge in having a robust customer base while continuing to reinvest in the customer experience and maximize their customer lifetime value.

Contoso Coffee wants to provide customers with the ability to ask questions about their order status and delivery time and to modify their order and cancel it. This new initiative will unlock some capabilities for the call center staff and will help deflect common questions that are time-consuming on the phone, ensuring greater customer satisfaction and saving live agents' time.

Customer support costs have continued to rise as the customer base has grown, and the company can no longer continue to expand its customer support team. As a result, you've been tasked with helping them find a solution by using Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Prerequisites
Some labs, especially later ones, reference previous labs in regard to capabilities and previous tasks. The labs have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial where you use the latest unified authoring canvas, you can get started from any lab without needing to complete the previous module to move forward. However, for the best experience in learning about the product’s features and functionality, we recommend that you complete specific modules before starting some labs.

As previously mentioned, to continue with the labs in this module, you'll also need to ensure that you have access to the environment that your instructor has provided or that you've created.
