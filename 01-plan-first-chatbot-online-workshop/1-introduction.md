# Introduction

These beginner-level labs give you hands-on experience in designing and developing an agent with Microsoft Copilot Studio by using its new unified authoring canvas. For more information about this latest announcement, see the Microsoft Copilot Studio blog.

This lab experience shows you the steps to build your agent in less than a day.

### The labs in this module show you how to:

* Access Microsoft Copilot Studio.
* Create a new topic within Microsoft Copilot Studio.
* Use the latest authoring canvas to build your topic by using authoring tools, including questions, messages, variables, and Microsoft Power Fx.
* Make your agent more powerful by integrating Microsoft Power Automate and external data.

### Setup and prerequisites

Your instructor sets up a tenant with resources for you to use to work through these lab materials. Follow the instructions that your trainer provides for signing in before you start the labs.

### How to work through these materials without a trainer

If you're working through these materials independently without an instructor, you can sign up for a trial of Microsoft Copilot Studio with your work or school account by going to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com, where you can create the GA release Microsoft Copilot Studio agents and also the preview agents. Additionally, you can use the Microsoft 365 Developer Account and Microsoft Power Apps Developer Account to create tenants and services to sign up for a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial. For more information, see [the Signing up for a developer plan for Microsoft Copilot](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/blog/signing-up-for-a-developer-plan-for-power-virtual-agents/) Studio blog post.

### Verify licenses

To verify what licenses your tenant has access to, navigate to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft365.com/). In the Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to the Active users menu under Users in the left navigation menu, then select the user you'll be logging in with. With the selected user opened in the right fly-out menu, navigate to the Licenses and apps tab. Under Licenses and apps you'll be able to determine what licenses are applied to your account.

Users that have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license have the Copilot Studio feature of Copilot Chat enabled by default. Users that don't have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will need to utilize a pay-as-you-go billing plan set up through either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Power Platform admin center.

### Set up and access

Ensure that you have access to the tenant that your instructor set up and that you can access Microsoft Copilot Studio. Go to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/ and sign in with your provided credentials. Some first-run experiences might be offered within the application to help you when you're opening for the first time, and you can review these experiences before starting the rest of the labs.

### Responsible AI FAQs for the solution

Responsible AI FAQs are part of a broader effort to put [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?rtc=1) into practice. They aim to provide insights into the workings of AI technology, the decisions that can affect its performance and behavior, and the significance of considering the entire system, including the technology, people, and environment. We recommend that you use these FAQs to gain a deeper understanding of specific AI systems and features developed by Microsoft.
