## What's Missing in Copilot Studio?

Be aware of gaps you'll need to handle separately:

### 1. Job Posting
**Gap**: Copilot Studio doesn't post jobs
**Solution**:
- Use EGAT careers website
- Manual posting to job boards
- Or integrate via Power Automate

### 2. Candidate Portal
**Gap**: Candidates can't track application status
**Solution**:
- Email updates via Power Automate
- Simple Power Apps portal (optional)
- Or just email communication

### 3. Interview Scheduling
**Gap**: No built-in scheduling
**Solution**:
- Outlook calendar invites
- Bookings (if available)
- Or keep manual scheduling

### 4. Compliance Reporting
**Gap**: No EEO/compliance dashboards
**Solution**:
- Store data in Dataverse
- Build Power BI reports
- Or manual compliance tracking

### 5. Background Checks
**Gap**: No integration with screening services
**Solution**:
- Manual process (as current)
- Or build custom integration

**Bottom Line**: These gaps are manageable for EGAT's current scale. Add solutions as needed.
