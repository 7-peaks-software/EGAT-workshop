# Lab 02-01: Extending Agent Capabilities with Tools

## Introduction

Now that your agent has been built and grounded with knowledge, it's time to make it work. In this module, you'll learn how to extend your agent's capabilities by integrating real-world tools, building custom prompts, and configuring agent instructions to determine how your agent generates responses.

Tools in Copilot Studio enable agents to perform useful tasks like generating custom answers with prompts, executing automations with agent flows, and sending emails. You'll explore how to add these tools, indicate how the agent should use them in the agent instructions, and use generative orchestration to dynamically route user queries to the right tools.

This module has three exercises:

- Exercise 1 - Understand tools in Copilot Studio
- Exercise 2 - Build a custom prompt tool
- Exercise 3 - Build an agent flow

### Coffee machine customer service scenario

At Contoso Coffee live customer service agents have been trained to handle various situations that might arise from customers. Now, you want to put some of that deep training and knowledge into your agent to reduce the pressure on your agents. To give customers real-time responses, you'll add tools to your Contoso Coffee Support agent that accomplish tasks your live agents would otherwise be completing.

### Prerequisites

Some labs reference previous labs in regard to capabilities and previous tasks. The exercises have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial, you can get started from any exercise without needing to complete the previous module to move forward. However, for the best experience in learning about the product's features and functionality, we recommend that you complete modules in the order presented in the learning path.

### What you'll learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand the difference between the tools available in Copilot Studio.
- Add prebuilt tools using connectors to perform real-time tasks.
- Build and test a custom agent flow that initiates an order cancellation.
- Control how tools are utilized by the agent.
- Link multiple elements like prompts and agent flows into seamless conversational experiences.

Continue to the next unit to learn about the types of tools available and unlock the agent's ability to intelligently combine flows, prompts, and instructions.
