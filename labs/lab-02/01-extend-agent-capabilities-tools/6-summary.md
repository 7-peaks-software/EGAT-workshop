In this module, you explored how to transform your agent from a static responder into a dynamic, task-oriented assistant by combining agent flows, custom prompts, and orchestration.

You began by understanding the various tools and their uses in Copilot Studio, then built an agent flow for updating a record in the Machine Orders table.

To guide conversations with more precision, you built a custom prompt tool. This exercise demonstrated how to collect inputs from users, run those inputs through a structured prompt, and deliver customized, actionable responses.

## Key takeaways

- **Orchestration mode** defines how your agent makes decisions:
  - Classic mode relies on explicitly triggered topics.
  - Generative mode uses AI to select the best path—topics, tools, or knowledge—in real time.
- **Tools** let agents perform tasks like fetching weather data or sending emails without writing manual input prompts.
- **Agent flows** provide structured automation flows, ideal for instructing the agent to perform consistent, repeatable actions.
- **Custom prompts** enable natural language generation for tailored responses based on user-provided input and prompt configurations.

With these tools, your agent can now perform real-world tasks, guide users through complex workflows, and adapt to a wide range of queries. In the next module, you'll expand your agent's reach by giving it autonomous features that trigger the agent to engage when specific conditions are met.
