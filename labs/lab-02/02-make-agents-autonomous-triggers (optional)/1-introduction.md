# Lab 02-02: Making Agents Autonomous with Triggers

## Introduction

Agents in Microsoft Copilot Studio don't have to wait for a message to act, they can initiate conversations automatically in response to changes in your business data. This module explores autonomous triggers, which allow your agent to monitor systems and respond in real time when specific conditions are met.

Autonomous triggers transform your agent into a proactive assistant. By connecting to data events, like an email received inquiring about an order's status, you can ensure your agent is always listening for important updates and delivering timely, relevant responses.

This module has two exercises:

- Exercise 1 - Understand autonomous triggers
- Exercise 2 - Make your agent autonomous

### Coffee machine customer service scenario

Live customer support agents at Contoso Coffee often get overrun by customers asking for the status of their order and this simple process takes their time away from more effective ways to assist customers. In this module, you'll make your Contoso Support Agent autonomous by giving it access to triggers that inform the agent when an order status email is received, and respond to that email with the customer's order details.

### Prerequisites

Some labs reference previous labs in regard to capabilities and previous tasks. The exercises have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial, you can get started from any exercise without needing to complete the previous module to move forward. However, for the best experience in learning about the product's features and functionality, we recommend that you complete modules in the order presented in the learning path.

### What you'll learn

In this module, you'll explore how to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of autonomous triggers.
- Create a trigger that activates when a new email is received in a monitored Outlook inbox.
- Test and validate your trigger with real-world data.

Whether you're notifying a team about a new sales lead or initiating an automated response to a service update, autonomous triggers unlock a new level of agent intelligence and usefulness.

Continue to the next unit to learn the foundational concepts behind autonomous triggers before building your first one.
