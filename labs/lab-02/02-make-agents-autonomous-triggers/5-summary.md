In this module, you learned how to transform your agent into a proactive assistant by using autonomous triggers, event-driven flows that allow your agent to respond automatically to changes in your business data.

You began by understanding how autonomous triggers work and why they matter. These event-based mechanisms enable your agent to react to real-time updates, like an email received in a monitored inbox, without waiting for user input.

Next, you walked through building your first trigger using the When a new email arrives (V3) Office 365 Outlook connector. You configured the trigger's detailed information, added tools to act off the triggered event, customized the instructions that indicate how the agent should handle these requests, and verified the trigger's functionality through testing.

## Key takeaways

- Autonomous triggers enable agents to initiate conversations based on data-driven events, not just user messages.
- Power Automate is used behind the scenes to define what event activates the agent and what message is sent.
- Triggers can be extended with tools to ensure action is being taken on a listened event.
- Testing and refining your trigger logic ensures accuracy and improves trust in the agent's responses.

With autonomous triggers in place, your agent is now capable of real-time, context-aware engagement.
