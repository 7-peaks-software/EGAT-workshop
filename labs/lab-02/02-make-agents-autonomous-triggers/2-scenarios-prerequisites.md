# Scenarios and Prerequisites

## Coffee machine customer service scenario

Live customer support agents at Contoso Coffee often get overrun by customers asking for the status of their order and this simple process takes their time away from more effective ways to assist customers. In this module, you'll make your Contoso Support Agent autonomous by giving it access to triggers that inform the agent when an order status email is received, and respond to that email with the customer's order details.

## Prerequisites

Some labs reference previous labs in regard to capabilities and previous tasks. The exercises have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial, you can get started from any exercise without needing to complete the previous module to move forward. However, for the best experience in learning about the product's features and functionality, we recommend that you complete modules in the order presented in the learning path.

## What you'll learn

In this module, you'll explore how to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of autonomous triggers.
- Create a trigger that activates when a new email is received in a monitored Outlook inbox.
- Test and validate your trigger with real-world data.
