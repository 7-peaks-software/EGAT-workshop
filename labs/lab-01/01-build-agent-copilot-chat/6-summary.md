# Summary

In this module, you explored how Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat enables the rapid creation and customization of intelligent agents. You began by learning how to navigate Copilot Chat, understand its agent-building capabilities, and identify licensing requirements.

You then used the Agent Builder to create an agent from a prebuilt template, experimenting with configuration options like agent instructions and starter prompts. Finally, you built a custom support agent from scratch, setting up clear behavior rules, meaningful prompts, and an actionable knowledge source.

## Key takeaways

- Copilot Chat provides an accessible way to build AI-powered agents directly within Microsoft 365.
- Agent templates offer quick-start options for building agents tailored to specific roles and workflows.
- Custom agents allow fine-grained control over instructions, user interactions, and visibility.
- Copilot Pages make it easy to capture, refine, and share AI-generated responses.

Now that you're familiar with the fundamentals of building agents in Copilot Chat. In the next module, you'll explore Copilot Studio, where you'll create and customize an internal-facing Contoso Coffee agent with advanced features like Dataverse integration, AI knowledge, and Orchestration modes.

## Next steps

With your deeper knowledge about how to create a custom agent with Copilot Chat, you can now consume data from employee handbooks, product catalogs, or rules and regulations for a government entity to provide clean and concise instructions for internal employees to service customers faster. Try uploading your employee onboarding handbook to a new agent to experiment with getting easier answers about your own company.
