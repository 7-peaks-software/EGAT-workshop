# Introduction

*5 minutes*

Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat makes it easy to build intelligent, task-specific agents that enhance productivity across your organization. In this module, you'll explore the fundamentals of agent creation using Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, and gradually progress toward advanced customization in Copilot Studio.

This module has three exercises:
- Exercise 1 - Copilot Chat exploration
- Exercise 2 - Using Copilot Chat agent templates
- Exercise 3 - Building a custom agent

## Coffee machine customer service scenario

Imagine you work for Contoso Coffee, an organization that distributes top of the line coffee machines to companies around the world. The organization would like to build a customized agent and standardize its customer service processes to make it easier to understand the return policies for Contoso. Contoso would also like to simplify the response to emails and order cancellation requests from its customers and build a bot to respond to emails automatically.

## Set up and access

To get started, ensure that your tenant has access via either a Pay-As-You-Go plan or a Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription.

### Verify your license

To verify what licenses your tenant has access to, navigate to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft365.com). In the Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to the Active users menu under Users in the left navigation menu, then select the user you'll be logging in with. With the selected user opened in the right fly-out menu, navigate to the Licenses and apps tab. Under Licenses and apps you'll be able to determine what licenses are applied to your account. The Billing tab in the left navigation menu displays tenant-wide capacity and product license information.

Users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license have the agent builder feature of Copilot Chat enabled by default. Users that don't have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license needs to [set up a pay-as-you-go billing plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-set-up?tabs=classic) through either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Power Platform admin center.

### If you're attending an instructor-led workshop

If you're attending an Instructor-led Agent in a Day event, you may be provided a tenant to use from your instructor that will be pre-configured for you to use. This tenant will have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license and a Microsoft Copilot Studio license, which will provide access to all the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat features used in this module.

### Accessing Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

You can access Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat by navigating to Copilot Chat and signing in with your provided credentials. Some first-run experiences might be offered within the application to help you when you're opening for the first time, and you can review these experiences before starting the rest of the labs.

### About Agent Builder

Creating agents in Copilot Chat makes use of Agent Builder, a technology built from Copilot Studio's architecture. More information on building and managing agents in Copilot Chat can be found in the [Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat agents documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/agents).

## What you'll learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Understand what Copilot Chat is and how it fits into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
- Build and customize agents using natural language and guided configuration tools.
- Use prebuilt templates to quickly create agents tailored to common business scenarios.
- Create your own custom agent with detailed instructions, starter prompts, and knowledge.
