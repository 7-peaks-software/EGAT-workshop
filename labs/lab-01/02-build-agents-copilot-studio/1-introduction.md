# Introduction

**Duration:** 5 minutes

Now that you've explored how to build and test agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, it's time to step into Copilot Studio, a more robust and flexible environment for designing intelligent agents. In this module, you'll go beyond basic configurations and learn how to build a fully featured agent using guided, conversational, and manual tools.

Microsoft Copilot Studio offers deeper customization through structured solutions, expanded knowledge integration, and control over agent direction. Whether you're building from a blank slate or refining an existing agent, this module helps you unlock the full potential of agent development.

This module has four exercises:
- Exercise 1 - Importing a Dataverse solution and creating test records.
- Exercise 2 - Agent creation in Copilot Studio using natural language.
- Exercise 3 - Tour the interface in Copilot Studio.
- Exercise 4 - Providing access to knowledge sources.

## Coffee Machine Customer Service Scenario

Imagine you work for Contoso Coffee, an organization that distributes top of the line coffee machines to companies around the world. The organization would like to build a customized agent that standardizes its customer service process to make it easier to understand the return policies for Contoso. Questions come into customer service in various ways like email, phone, and chat. Contoso would like to reduce the amount of manual effort in responding to these customer questions to save cost for this growing company.

## Prerequisites

The exercises have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial, you can get started from any exercise without needing to complete the previous module to move forward.

If you're working through these materials independently without an instructor, you can sign up for a trial of Microsoft Copilot Studio with your work or school account by going to the Copilot Studio trial sign-up. For more information, see the [Signing up for a developer plan for Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/blog/signing-up-for-a-developer-plan-for-power-virtual-agents/?azure-portal=true) blog post.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Import a Dataverse solution.
- Build an agent in Copilot Studio using natural language input and configure advanced behavior settings.
- Navigate Copilot Studio's interface, including key sections in the Overview page like, Topics, Knowledge, and Tools.
- Control the agent's pretrained data by modifying its knowledge sources.
- Add internal and external data as agent knowledge sources.

Continue to the next unit to start importing a Dataverse solution that will be used to build your agent in Copilot Studio.
