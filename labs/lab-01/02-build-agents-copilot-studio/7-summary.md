# Summary

In this module, you took your first steps into Microsoft Copilot Studio, a more advanced, and customizable platform for building AI agents. You began by importing a solution to organize and manage your agent components, ensuring a structured foundation for future development.

Using the conversational agent builder, you defined the tone, personality, and behavior of your agent with natural language input. You also toured the Copilot Studio interface, exploring essential areas in the Overview page that give you full control over how your agent behaves and responds.

To enhance the reliability of your agent, you learned how to ground your agent's responses in trusted sources like Dataverse tables and external text files. This ensures that your agent delivers accurate, context-aware answers tailored to your organization's needs.

## Key takeaways

- Solutions help keep your agent and its related components organized across environments.
- Copilot Studio offers both conversational and manual workflows for agent creation and configuration.
- Knowledge control is critical for preventing incorrect information and ensuring your agent provides fact-based responses.
- Dataverse and files can be added as grounding knowledge sources to expand your agent's expertise.

You're now equipped to build intelligent, grounded, and scalable agents using Copilot Studio. In the next module, you'll deepen this knowledge by connecting your agents to real-world tools and automation using Power Automate and custom prompts.

## Next Steps

You've now built a Copilot Studio agent, which can respond through various channels like chat, Facebook, Microsoft Teams, or phone for example. While it's not required for this class, if you wish to complete your agent for testing or production, your final step would be to publish the agent and select a channel to host the agent. For more information about how to use channels, see [Fundamentals of publishing agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels).
