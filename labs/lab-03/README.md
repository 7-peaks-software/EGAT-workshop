# Lab 03 - Multi-Agent Orchestration and Advanced Integration

This lab focuses on advanced Copilot Studio features including multi-agent orchestration, agent handoffs, and enterprise integrations.

## Overview

In this lab, you'll learn how to build sophisticated multi-agent systems where specialized agents work together to handle complex scenarios. You'll enhance your maintenance agent with escalation logic, integrate with Microsoft Teams for notifications, and test multi-turn conversations.

## Modules

### 01 - Multi-Agent Orchestration & Integration
Learn how to orchestrate multiple agents, implement handoff logic, and integrate with Microsoft Teams for real-world business scenarios.
