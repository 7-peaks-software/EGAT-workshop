# Multi-Agent Orchestration & Integration - Online Workshop

**Module Duration:** 9 Units

## Overview

Learn how to build sophisticated multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to handle complex business scenarios. In this module, you'll enhance your maintenance agent with escalation logic, integrate with Microsoft Teams for notifications, and master the art of multi-agent orchestration.

## Learning Objectives

This module explains how to:
- Understand multi-agent orchestration patterns and best practices
- Create specialized agents for specific business functions
- Implement handoff logic between agents
- Add escalation workflows to maintenance agents
- Integrate Microsoft Teams for real-time notifications
- Use generative AI for complex, dynamic responses
- Test and validate multi-turn conversation scenarios
- Deploy multi-agent systems for enterprise use

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Lab 01 and Lab 02
- Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Microsoft Teams access
- Power Automate basic knowledge
- An existing maintenance agent (or ability to create one)

## Scenario

EGAT's maintenance department receives various types of service requests that require different levels of expertise. Some requests can be handled by a basic FAQ agent, while others need specialist attention. You'll build a multi-agent system where:

- **Tier 1 Agent** handles common questions and basic requests
- **Maintenance Specialist Agent** handles technical maintenance issues
- **Emergency Response Agent** handles urgent/critical situations
- **Teams Integration** notifies the appropriate team members

The system will intelligently route conversations between agents based on complexity, urgency, and expertise required.
